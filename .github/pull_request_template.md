## What was done?

## Accessibility

- [ ] I have checked this with the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
- [ ] I have tested with a screenreader
  - [ ] All actions can be performed by a screenreader user
  - [ ] All information available to a sighted user is equivalently available via the screenreader
    - [ ] Headings do not skip levels, and are a good "content summary" of the page
    - [ ] Keyboard-tabbing/screenreader traversal order makes sense
    - [ ] All visual information associated with a form field (labels, descriptions, errors) is
          programmatically associated with that field
    - [ ] Any user actions trigger screenreader feedback to inform what is happening

## How should a reviewer test?

- Locally, run `npm install` then `npm run dev`, and go to http://localhost:3000/
