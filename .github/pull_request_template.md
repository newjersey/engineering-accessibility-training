## What was done?

## Accessibility

- [ ] I have checked this with the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/).
- [ ] I have tested with a screenreader, and all information available to a sighted user is
      equivalently available to a screenreader user
  - [ ] All visual information associated with a form field (labels, descriptions, errors) is
        programmatically associated with that field
  - [ ] Keyboard-tabbing/screenreader traversal order makes sense
  - [ ] Headings do not skip levels, and the heading structure is an appropriate content summary of
        the page
  - [ ] All user actions trigger screen reader feedback that enables users to understand what is
        going on
- [ ] All actions a sighted user can perform can be performed by a screenreader user

## How should a reviewer test?

- Locally, run `npm install` then `npm run dev`, and go to http://localhost:3000/
